We will place a light sensor that turns on and off according to light strength if there is light coming inside so there is no need to waste power otherwise the lights are off. Meanwhile we have a motion sensor and the light sensor will control the lights outside, the outdoors lights are also connected to the light sensor. Additionally we also will have a soil moisture sensor that measures the humidity in the plants also we will have the dth11 sensor. 

The main idea behind this project is to make a smart greenhouse that saves energy and electricity by placing the light sensor on top of the roof where the sunlight can reach the sensor, the sensor will be connected to indoor lights which plants need and the same sensor will be connected to outdoor lights which will be also connected to a motion sensor. Outdoor lights will be ON only if it detects some movement and there is no light outside.
The soil moisture sensor will detect the humidity in the plants and if itâ€™s dry and needs water will send either an alert via sms or email. Also the dth11 sensor will detect the humidity and the temperature in the whole greenhouse which will be connected to an engine which in its turn either opens a window/fan or closes it depending on temperature.
